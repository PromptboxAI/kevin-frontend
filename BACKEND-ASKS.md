# Backend asks from the frontend build

Raised while wiring the production worksheet against the live API.

## 1. `ClaimSummary` needs `total_tax` (and ideally `total_depreciation`)

The design's totals bar is five boxes: **Items · RCV · Depreciation · Tax · ACV**.
`GET /v1/claims` returns `total_rcv`, `total_acv`, `item_count`, `photo_count` —
no tax or depreciation total.

- **Depreciation** is currently restated from the money contract's own identity
  (`acv_total_incl = rcv_total_incl − depreciation_amount`, so
  `Depr = total_rcv − total_acv`). It works, but clients should not have to
  restate server math. There is a `TODO` on that line to read
  `total_depreciation` verbatim once it exists.
- **Tax has no identity to recover it from.** The box renders a dash. Summing
  the loaded page client-side would be wrong money — only part of the claim is
  in memory, and the frontend does not do money arithmetic.

## 2. Bulk retry for capacity-deferred rows

`POST /v1/claim_items/retry-deferred` appears in the prototype spec but does not
exist on the live API. **Confirmed being built as
`POST /v1/claims/{claim_id}/retry-deferred`** (claim-scoped, retries only
`quota_exhausted` / `budget_exhausted` rows, skips genuine `needs_manual`).

Interim frontend behavior: the deferred bar renders and names the count, but the
Retry action is **disabled** pending that route. Looping per-row
`POST …/reprice` would burn the shared `/process` 30/min limit — on a claim with
200+ deferred rows that is several minutes and multiple passes for a worse
result.

## 3. `items/bulk` should accept an empty description with `price: false`

Adding a line item without a photo is a one-row `POST /v1/claims/{id}/items/bulk`
call, which is right. But `description` is required at **2–300 chars**, so a
deliberately blank template line cannot be created in one call.

That conflicts with the contract's own `placeholder_row` concept — a line that
means *the adjuster fills this in*. The frontend currently works around it:

1. create the row with a throwaway description, then
2. immediately `PATCH /v1/claim_items/{id}` with `description: null` to clear it.

Two round-trips, and a transient "New item" flashes in the grid before the PATCH
lands (it also matches searches for that moment). **Allowing an empty-string
description when `price: false`** would make this one call with no flash — the
row is deliberately unpriced anyway, so there is nothing to search against.

## 4. Claim intake metadata is null on every existing claim

`ClaimSummary` *does* carry `date_of_loss`, `loss_address`, `carrier`,
`policy_number` and `claim_number` — the fields exist. But every claim in the
demo account has them null, because claims auto-materialise from
`POST /v1/process` / staging uploads, which capture no intake metadata.

The worksheet header now renders the labels with a dash rather than omitting
them (silent omission is what the design forbids). Nothing is needed from the
API — but the **intake flow must send this metadata on create**, or the header
stays dashed in production too.

## 5. Adjuster-entered proof URL on manually priced lines

**When Kevin prices a line, `alternative_sources[0].link` is the
substantiation. When an adjuster overrides or manually prices a line, the comps
drop and there is no field to carry their own proof** — a receipt page, a
retailer listing they found, an appraisal URL. The export's Source Link column
then prints blank for exactly the lines a carrier questions hardest.

This blocks a locked product rule: CLAUDE.md rule 12 says entering a manual
value "exposes the `+` affordance to attach a proof URL". It is a backend gap,
not a design cut.

**Request:** a `manual_source_url` (or accept a single-element
`alternative_sources` write) on `PATCH /v1/claim_items/{row_id}` — descriptive
edit semantics, so no valuation change and no `overridden` flag — validated as
a URL, rendered in the Link column and emitted in exports the same way an
engine comp link is.

**Frontend behavior is already designed and waiting:** a dashed `+ add` chip on
link-less rows (`k-src-add`) → inline URL input (`k-src-input`) → saves on
commit. Until the field exists the Link cell stays **empty** — not a chip —
because a control that accepts a URL and discards it leaves the adjuster
believing the line is substantiated.

## 6. Smaller notes

- `ClaimItemSummary` has no `ext_cost`. The worksheet's **Ext. Cost** column is
  restated from `rcv_total_incl − tax` (the contract guarantees
  `Ext + Tax == RCV + Tax`). A server field would remove the last piece of
  client-side money restatement.
- No bulk category endpoint — re-categorizing a selection loops
  `PATCH …/override` per row. Fine at current selection sizes; worth revisiting
  if bulk edits get large.
